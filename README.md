# Sql-Data-WareHouse
Building a modern Data Warehouse with SQL Server, Including ETL processes, data modelling and analytics.

🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse Project
This project is a fully modernized data warehouse built using SQL and best practices in data engineering. It is designed to provide scalable, reliable, and efficient analytical infrastructure for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

🔍 Overview 

The data warehouse implements a modular, layered architecture, separating concerns across staging, transformation, and presentation layers. It integrates structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources, applies business logic through robust SQL transformations, and exposes clean, analytics-ready datasets.

This project involves:
Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
